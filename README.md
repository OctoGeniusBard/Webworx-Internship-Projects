## DocGen - Automated Document Generation System

### 📌 **Project Overview**  
DocGen is a **web-based document generation application** that automates the process of creating various official documents, such as **Internship Offer Letters, Appointment Letters, and Completion Certificates**. This eliminates **manual document creation**, reduces **time consumption**, and ensures **data consistency**. The generated documents are automatically converted into **PDF format**, making them easy to store and share.  

---

### 🔥 **Problem Statement**  
The **existing system** for document creation at Webworx Pvt. Ltd. was **manual and time-consuming**.  
- Employees had to **type each document manually**, even when most of the content remained the same.  
- There was **no centralized database** for storing employee details.  
- Formatting **was inconsistent** and prone to errors.  

🔴 **Example Issue:** If 10 new interns were hired, the HR team had to **manually create 10 separate Internship Offer Letters**, even though most details were identical.

### 💡 **Proposed Solution**  
DocGen automates **document creation & formatting** by:  
✅ **Fetching employee details dynamically** from the database.  
✅ Using **predefined templates** to maintain consistency.  
✅ Generating **PDFs instantly** with a single click.  
✅ Allowing **quick edits & updates** before final document creation.

### 🌟 **Key Features**  
✅ **Automated Document Generation** – Create structured documents in a single click.  
✅ **PDF Export** – Documents are automatically converted into **PDF format**.  
✅ **Employee & Candidate Data Management** – Store and retrieve employee details dynamically.  
✅ **Custom Templates** – Standardized templates for various documents.  
✅ **Secure Access** – Role-based authentication for document generation.
